## WiiLabyrinthe

A 3rd year project, we made a wood Labyrinthe with a Raspberry and servomotor which is controlable with a Nunchuck.
> The WiiLabyrinth is a game, the principle of which is to move the maze using a Nunchuck, connected to a Wiimote, to drop a ball > in the centre of the maze. The game is timed, and to win, you have to go to the centre of the maze in less than 25 seconds.
